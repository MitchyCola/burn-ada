These are the stored artifacts that were used for the creation of the mainnet burn address.

All of the files, except this `README.md` and the `burn.utxo`, were created via the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/MitchyCola/burn-ada/blob/main/.github/workflows/burn-job.yaml) from the [main branch](https://github.com/MitchyCola/burn-ada).

The `burn.utxo` is the result of successfully submitting the [transaction](https://adatools.io/transactions/ee2b90b715a5a1ec030d5116933b466fa742fffa19a2597798f4c4ef7de2f8d3) that was built from `submit-tx.sh`. This UTxO contains an [NFT](https://adatools.io/assets/asset10ajm99533veg945mvladsfu638j33uke945z4j), which signifies that the address is a burn address and that nobody controls the private keys.
